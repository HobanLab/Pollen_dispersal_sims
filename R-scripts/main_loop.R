#Main loop

#assinging mating, pollen dispersal, and seed collecting in the population
#Then, the results of sampling are saved

#DEFINING VARIABLES 

num_loci = 20 #number of loci simulated, needed to make a dataframe to save the data

#defining array to store seeds that collectors have 'sampled'
#first we need to create column names depending on how many loci are present in simulations
#then, define the matrix, convert to dataframe, and rename the columns to label the data
#this dataframe keeps track of the alleles that are captured during sampling

#creating a container to store the results of sampling and other important data
# five columns to save the proportion of alleles captured, 
#number of seeds sampled, number of trees sampled, pollen donor type (6 cols),
#number of alleles captured, total and number of alleles present, and simulation replicate 
#each row indicates the scenario (465)
#the third dimension is the simulation replicate (50)
#saving each of the pollen donor scenarios in different arrays--we can combine them later if we need to! 
  #this is just easier because it's less filtering and more organized
#Idealized scenarios
