###
#This script fills a list containing sets of function parameters (scenarios for 'simulation')
#The loop goes through each number of maternal trees (50, 25, 10, 5, 2, 1) sampling a different
#number of seeds per tree, from 1 to (250/number of maternal trees to sample) 
#each loop iteration, three 'scenarios' of parameters are made--seed sets made by a single father (all same),
#seed sets made by multiple fathers with equal donation (all unique), and seed sets created by mutliple
#fathers with skewed pollen donation (skewed--one donates 80%, the rest donate evenly)
